# Transgene Library

This directory contains the transgene sequences used for BLAST analysis.

## Adding New Transgenes

1. Add the FASTA file to this directory
2. Update `transgene_library.csv` with the new entry
3. Update your `samples.csv` to reference the new transgene name

## File Format

- FASTA files should contain a single sequence
- Use descriptive sequence headers
- File names should match the transgene_name in the library CSV
